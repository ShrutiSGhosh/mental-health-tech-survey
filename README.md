## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between workplace factors and mental health attitudes in the tech industry. Using a dataset of approximately 1,500 responses, I analyzed how conditions like anonymity, benefits, family history, and remote work impact the likelihood of seeking mental health treatment.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand how various workplace factors affect employees' decisions to seek mental health support.
- Identify the strongest predictors of treatment-seeking behavior.
- Use Python and visualization to present insights in a simple, impactful way.

## 📊 Key Tools Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas 📚
- Matplotlib 🎨
- Jupyter Notebook 📒

## 📈 Highlights from Analysis

- 📌 Employees with **family history** of mental illness are 3× more likely to seek help.
- 📌 **Anonymity protection** and **access to care options** significantly improve treatment-seeking behavior.
- 📌 Surprisingly, supervisor comfort and remote work show limited influence.

## 🧪 Methodology

- Cleaned and processed raw survey data using Pandas
- Used cross-tabulation and percentage-stacked bar charts
- Extracted insights using EDA and visual storytelling
- Saved charts and packaged insights into a final PPT + report
